# Super Duo - Football Scores and Alexandria apps

Developed for Project 3 as part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity.

## Prerequisities

The apps aren't available via Google Play, but you can build them and sideload them onto any Android device or Android emulator.

## Installing

The repository contains two Android projects. After cloning the repository, go to the directory of the one you want to install, and build and install using [this guideline](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html)

## Football Scores

Displays five days of football (soccer, not American football) matches: today's, yesterday's, the day before yesterday's, and tomorrow's & the day after tomorrow's. Scores are shown in cases where the games have been played. The app also implements a widget that presents the data as summaries in a listview.

## Alexandria

Maintains a database of books the user has entered using ISBNs. It implements a barcode scanner to make it easier to get books into the system.

## Authors

The original code was provided by Udacity, and modified by [George Cohn](https://github.com/GeoCohn) to fix bugs and implement new features such as the Football Scores widget and the Alexandria ISBN barcode scanner.
